stand out = to be very noticeable: The black lettering really stands out on that orange background.
piss off = to leave or go away, used especially as a rude way of telling someone to go away: Everyone just pissed off and left me to clean up. Why don't you just piss off - you've caused enough problems already!
stay up = to go to bed later than usual: We stayed up (late) to watch a film. I stayed up to watch the Olympics on television. The kids were allowed to stay up till midnight on New Year's Eve. I'll be late home so don't stay up waiting for me. We stayed up till 3.00, chatting about old times. These days if I stay up late one night I'm exhausted the next morning.
